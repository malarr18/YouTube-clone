# YouTube Homepage Clone (HTML & CSS)

This is a simple YouTube homepage clone that I built while practicing HTML and CSS.  
The main idea was to understand how layouts, flexbox, and basic UI structure work in real websites.

---

## Features
- Top navigation bar similar to YouTube  
- Sidebar with icons  
- Video preview cards with thumbnails  
- Basic layout using Flexbox  

---

## What I learned
- Structuring a page using HTML  
- Working with CSS Flexbox  
- Organizing files into folders (icons, thumbnails, styles)  
- Recreating a real UI from scratch  

---

## Project Structure
/channel-pictures
/icons
/styles
/thumbnails
index.html

## Live Demo
GitHub Pages: https://malarr18.github.io/YouTube-clone/

## Future Improvements
- Make the page responsive  
- Add JavaScript for interactions  
- Improve the UI and spacing

This is one of my practice projects as I learn web development. More coming soon!
